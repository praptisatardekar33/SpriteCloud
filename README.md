# SpriteCloud Assignment

a. How to run the tests locally--- 
For web automation project(SpriteCloud_UI), run the TestNg.xml file. For this project I have used IntelliJ Idea platform.
For API automation project(SpriteCloud_API), run the feature files under src/test/java/features package. Please run the featues as Cucumber feature.

b. Link to the results in Calliope.pro--- 
https://app.calliope.pro/profiles/4523/reports 

As html format isn't supported I was abe to upload only web automation result.

c. Describe one improvement point and one new feature for the Calliope.pro platform---
A security feature can be added while sharing the log files.

d.What you used to select the scenarios, what was your approach?---
Web automation:
Initially I started the automation with easier scenarios. Moving forward I chose the scenarios which i had not worked on before so that I could get a chance to learn    new things.
API automation:
As I had never worked on API before, I chose the scenarios which were suitable for automation as a beginner.

e. Why are they the most important---
Every scenaio which I have chosen has added knowledge to my automation skills and increases my confidence in automation. Hence evey scenario is important fom knowledge gaining importance.

f. What could be the next steps to your project---
The Web Automation project which I have developed does not totally fulfill the framework reuirements as I am still in the learnig phase. Hence my steps would be learnig more about automation and makig improvements in the project accordingly. 
For API autmation my next stps would be to learn more about Karate tool as well as other tools available for API automation.
